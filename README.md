<h1 align="center"> How to use multiple code files in C++ for beginners.</h1>

When we code in a programming language, if our code is a small console application, then we can easily make this in a single file. But, once our program gets larger. We should split our programs in multiple files for easy maintainability and reusability of our code.

To do this, we strongly recommend using an IDE. this will greatly ease the process. Although you can also use [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), we suggest you use [Visual studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)(it is free) In this article we will be using Visual studio Community.
